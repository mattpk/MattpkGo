MattpkGo Ai

made by Matthew Chung

To run on KGS, create and register a bot account and confirm the email,
and edit the .bat file to change your bot's name.
You need to create an .ini file with the following format (mine isn't commited bcause of the password)
and change the username and passsword.

Have fun
